# Preface {.unnumbered}


This work is intended to foster best practices in reproducible data documentation and manipulation, statistical analysis, graphics, and reporting.  It will enable the reader to efficiently produce attractive, readable, and reproducible research reports while keeping code concise and clear.  Readers are also guided in choosing statistically efficient descriptive analyses that are consonant with the type of data being analyzed.  The _Statistical Thinking_ article [R Workflow](https://fharrell.com/post/rflow) provides an overview of this book and includes some more motivation from the standpoint of doing good scientific research.[[Comments](https://hbiostat.org/comment.html)]{.aside}

Anyone who claims to be able to do good data science without coding is misleading you.  Coding is one of the most valuable skills for data preparation and analysis, and it leads to personal efficiency, reproducibility, and maintainability.  Learning how to write concise, elegant, debug-able code that generalizes to handle more complex tasks is not an insurmountable goal for anyone dealing with data, and `R Workflow` is intended to assist you in this regard.

The methods in `R Workflow` will be helpful to anyone who analyzes data, whether they work in business, marketing, manufacturing, journalism, finance, science, observational research, experimental research, and virtually any field needing to understand data.  The book is best suited for those having at least rudimentary experience in running R commands, but @sec-rbasics points readers to excellent resources for learning R from scratch.  R can also be learned by starting with some standard analysis templates such as this in [this Github repository](https://github.com/harrelfe/rscripts).

The work also showcases RStudio's [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org) which is a new standard for making beautiful and reproducible reports with R and other languages.  This book also captures what I've learned in using R (and its precursor S) heavily in biomedical research and clinical trials since 1991.  See my _Statistical Thinking_ blog [`fharrell.com`](https://fharrell.com) and resources at [`hbiostat.org`](https://hbiostat.org) for more.

The term "workflow" connotes a rigid step-by-step process of data processing and reporting.  In one's day-to-day usage of R, myriad needs arise, and much creativity is needed to get the most insights from data while writing reliable code that generates reproducible results.  `R Workflow` will equip R users/analysts with a variety of powerful and flexible tools that will assist them in attacking a huge variety of problems and producing elegant reports while reducing the amount of coding required.

A video covering many parts of the first 13 chapters may be found [here](https://youtu.be/ULWClhwrN2U).

The general statistical analysis/inference companion to this book is [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](https://hbiostat.org/bbr) which is a reproducible book with numerous examples of R code.  For and in-depth text and course notes on reproducible regression modeling with R, including extensive case studies, see [RMS](https://hbiostat.org/rms).
